I want to try to learn a bit of Biodata analisys, in particular GWAS. In this repository I will upload the scripts.
All the work is performed on LINUX machine.

Contents of the scripts:
1. "Script1_QC_finito.sh": it's the script to perform the Quality Check on the SNPs
2. "Script2_PCA.sh": it's the script to perfotm the PCA on the samples
3. "population_info": this is the txt file that contains the information of the samples' population
4. "PCA-plot": this is the python script to plot the PCA
